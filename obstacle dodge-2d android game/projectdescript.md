2.2.4.1 Requirements gathering phase
In this phase, the proponents will gather or acquire different information needed to develop the game. First, the proponents searched about different games with the same concept that they will develop and analysed it to get different ideas on how to improve the game they will develop. The proponents also looked for existing project that can help them to improve the game.
2.2.4.2 Designing phase
In this phase, the Proponents designed and developed the objects in the game. They used storyboard to decide what the game looks like. The Proponents used the knowledge they gathered for references.
2.2.4.3 Implementation Phase
In this phase, the proponents implement the design into code. They tested the adaptability and portability of the game application. And also, during this phase, Integration issue are solved. The programming language that the proponents will use is C#.

2.2.4.4 Testing phase
In this phase, the proponents evaluate test and install and develop user support. The Coding and debugging will be done. The proponents will use black box testing to test the application.
